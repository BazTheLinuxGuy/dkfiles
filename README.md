This application, amateur though it is, is designed to record the contents, location, and owner of each file. The files I am talking about are paper
files, the kind you put in hanging file folders.

My husband and I have serveral filing cabinets for files, and often the way we find the file we're looking for (e.g., dental insurance information)
is to use the web application's "lookup" feature.
